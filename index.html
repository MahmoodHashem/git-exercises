      <h2>Changing History</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Changing the last commit
          <p>
            Use <code>git commit --amend</code> <br />
            Remember to only amend commits that have not been pushed anywhere!
            The reason for this is that git commit --amend does not edit the
            last commit, it replaces that commit with an entirely new one.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Changing multiple commits
          <p>
            This is where the beautiful command <code>git rebase</code> comes
            into play!
          </p>
          <h3>Starting an Interactive Rebase</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Initiate the Rebase:</li>
            <p>To start an interactive rebase, use the following command:</p>
            <code> git rebase -i HEAD~N </code>
            <p>
              Replace N with the number of commits you want to affect. For
              example, if you want to modify the last 3 commits, use HEAD~3.
            </p>
            <li>
              Understanding the Interactive Rebase Editor
              <p>
                When you run the command, Git will open your default text editor
                with a list of commits, similar to this:
              </p>
              <code class="git">
                pick abc123 Commit message 1 pick def456 Commit message 2 pick
                ghi789 Commit message 3
              </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Commands You Can Use
              <p>
                In the editor, you can replace the word pick with several
                commands:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>pick:</b>Use the commit as is.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>reword:</b>Use the commit but change its commit message.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>edit:</b> Pause the rebase after this commit so you can
                  modify it (e.g., change the content).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>squash:</b> Combine this commit with the previous commit.
                  You’ll be prompted to edit the commit message for the combined
                  commit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>fixup:</b> Similar to squash, but it discards the commit
                  message of the squashed commit.
                </li>
                <li><b>drop:</b>Remove the commit entirely.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Splitting up a commit
          <p>
            <code>git reset</code> is a powerful command in Git that allows you
            to undo changes by resetting the current HEAD to a specified state.
            It can modify the staging area and working directory based on the
            reset options you choose.
          </p>

          <p>Types of Git reset</p>
          <ol>
            <h3>1. Soft Reset (<code>--soft</code>)</h3>
            <p>
              Moves the HEAD pointer to a specified commit but leaves your
              working directory and staging area (index) intact.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is useful if you want to uncommit changes but keep them
              staged for a new commit.
            </p>
            <pre><code>git reset --soft &lt;commit&gt;</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1</code></pre>
            <p>
              This command undoes the last commit, keeping the changes staged.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Mixed Reset (default)</h3>
            <p>
              Moves the HEAD pointer to a specified commit and resets the
              staging area to match, but leaves the working directory unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is useful if you want to unstage changes while keeping them
              in your working directory.
            </p>
            <pre><code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>git reset HEAD~1</code></pre>
            <p>
              This command undoes the last commit and unstages the changes, but
              the changes remain in your working directory.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Hard Reset (<code>--hard</code>)</h3>
            <p>
              Moves the HEAD pointer to a specified commit and resets both the
              staging area and working directory to match that commit.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is useful if you want to discard all changes since that
              commit.
            </p>
            <pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit&gt;</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1</code></pre>
            <p>
              This command undoes the last commit and discards all changes in
              the working directory and staging area.
            </p>
            
    <h2>Use Cases for Git Reset</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Undoing Commits:</strong> If you mistakenly committed changes, you can use <code>git reset</code> to undo the commit while deciding what to do next.</li>
        <li><strong>Unstaging Changes:</strong> If you accidentally staged changes you didn’t want to commit, a mixed reset will unstage them but keep them available for further edits.</li>
        <li><strong>Discarding Changes:</strong> If you want to completely remove changes made since a specific commit, a hard reset is appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
          </ol>
        </li>
