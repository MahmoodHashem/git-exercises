# Git Tutorial

I am currently working through the [A Deeper Look at Git | The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-a-deeper-look-at-git) lesson. This repository serves as a practice space for exploring advanced Git concepts and commands.

## Purpose

This repository is designed for practicing and exercising key Git functionalities, including:

* History-changing Git commands
* Different ways of changing history
* Using remotes to change history
* Dangers of history-changing operations
* Best practices of history-changing operations
* Pointers

## How Does It Work

In this repository, I create a new branch for each lesson I work on. This approach allows for better organization and experimentation with Git concepts without affecting the main branch. Each branch serves as a dedicated space to practice specific commands and techniques discussed in the lessons.



Feel free to explore the repository and follow along with the lesson. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and create your own branches to experiment with the commands discussed in the lesson:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-exercises.git
cd git-exercises
```
